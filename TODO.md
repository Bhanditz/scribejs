## Current status

* Testing will clearly reveal new bugs...

## Known bugs or missing features
* It would be nice if some sort of a mapping from nick names to full names could be generated into the header, but this seems to be fairly complicated, and would require maintaining a separate table per groupâ€¦
* RRSAgent seems to work for Present- and Regrets-. Maybe worth adding...
