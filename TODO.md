## Current status

* Testing will clearly reveal new bugs...

## Known bugs or missing features
* It would be nice if some sort of a mapping from nick names to full names could be generated into the header, but this seems to be fairly complicated, and would require maintaining a separate table per groupâ€¦
* If and when the [github markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is really implemented on github (at present it is not), it should be possible to add `<style>` elements to a file, thereby being able to color certain parts (using `<div>`, for example). At that point, it is worth changing the display of resolutions and actions to color them to, say, red and green, and make them bold (instead of using the blockquote as of now).
